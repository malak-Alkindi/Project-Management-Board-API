Thank you for this project. It was an enjoyable experience to work on.

My website includes several additional features:

1) It has two distinct pages that manage cards and boards.
2) On the boards page, I've integrated the ability to add new boards.
3) The boards page also includes a functionality to retrieve all boards, presented as individual divisions. These divisions enable actions such as deletion and navigation to the boards' corresponding cards by clicking on them.

4) In the card pages, aside from fulfilling the required specifications, I've incorporated a drag-and-drop feature.
5) I've integrated a card filtering mechanism, allowing users to search within the cards.
6) Furthermore, I've designed popup forms for both updating existing cards and creating new ones.
7) The styling of the website is responsive, ensuring compatibility across various screen sizes.
8) Lastly, I've streamlined the process of deletion and updating, making it possible to perform these actions with just a single click.

   note:
 The pages of the models were initially named with lowercase letters.
 However, it became apparent later on that these names should have started with uppercase letters.
Unfortunately, this realization came too late to make the necessary changes, and this oversight will have an impact on both the UI and API .
I plan to rectify the naming conventions in the upcoming days.
